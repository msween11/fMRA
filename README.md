Functional Multi-Reference Alignment via Deconvolution
This Readme is obviously a wip.

findz and center_BS are just technical files.

FUNC_singlerun and SCRIPT_singlerun are functional and script versions of the same file. They do the same things if the parameters are set the same. They perform a single run of the algorithm in the paper on a signal f1,...,f4 with either an aperiodic or uniform shift distribution.
